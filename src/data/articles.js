      "The College Dropout, released by Kanye West under Def Jam Records on February 10th, 2004, is West's freshman album.\n\nWith a runtime of 1 hour and 16 minutes, 13 performance features, and all-original \"producer rapping,\" The College Dropout encapsulates the story of West's early rise to fame, his relationships with others in Chi-town, and thanks and tributes to those who've helped him grow.\n\nHaving started producing in the mid 90's, West began building his career producing for local Chicago artists, and eventually worked his way up to labels, eventually being one of the main producers behind Jay-Z's The Blueprint, released in 2001.\nHowever, West wanted his career to be more than just producing, evident from his numerous attempts to show his skills off to major artists (which West himself talks about on Last Call, the album closer.)\nHowever, major labels believed that West didn't fit the image of what Hip-Hop represented at the time.\n\nBut that didn't stop West from being sought after by artists.\nAfter his success working on The Blueprint, many artists sought West out for beats similar to those he made for Jay-Z.\nWhile this did help West further his career, it wasn't quite what he wanted from music.\nHe wanted to be at the forefront of his work; he wanted his name to be known as something more than just a production credit.\nHe wanted fame, no matter what he had to go through.\n\n(Un)Luckily for West, he'd soon face one of the roughest parts of his life.\n\nIn 2002, while West was driving home from a recording session, he fell asleep at the wheel, and had a head-on collision with another car.\nWest was rushed to the hospital and received surgery, which required a metal plate to be put into his chin, and his mouth to be wired shut for a month.\nDuring his stay at the hospital, while laying in bed, West heard Chaka Khan's \"Through the Fire,\" which would serve as his inspiration in overcoming his injuries.\n\nOnly two weeks after his surgery, West had begun producing again, but this time, with his own voice as the main artist.\nSampling the song that had helped him regain his footing, West released \"Through the Wire,\" which - you guessed it - he performed while still having the wire in his mouth.\nUnbeknownst to some, Kanye had released this song first on his 2002 mixtape Get Well Soon..., but it was later remastered.\nHaving overcome his time as Chicago's underdog and a recovering patient, in 2004, West released his first album, titled The College Dropout.\n\nBut enough about West's history.\nLet's talk about the music.\n\nOne of the defining parts of West's early work is his clever lyricism, an abundance of which you can find on this record.\nSome of my personal favorites include:\n\n\"And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic // They favorite 50 Cent song '12 Questions'\" - \"We Don't Care\"\n\n\"Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis\" - \"All Falls Down\"\n\n\"But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph // Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire\" - \"Through The Wire\"\n\nAnd nearly every song on the album contains verses just as ingenious as these.\nBut bars aren't all West has in store for this album.\nHis flows also demonstrate his talent, such as his lines on \"Get Em High,\" \"Two Words,\" and \"Last Call.\"\nHowever, unlike lyrics, flow isn't something you can capture in words, so I do encourage you to listen to this album to fully appreciate West's talent.\n\nWest's production is another standout part of this album, as his signature \"Chipmunk Soul\" style shines through on most tracks on the album (that being, the style of chopping up soul samples and speeding them up.)\nWhile you can find lists of each song used in the production of the album online, my personal favorite was The Arc Choir's \"Walk With Me,\" on \"Jesus Walks.\"\nThe way the low chant repeats throughout the track really makes you feel like you're walking with Kanye and keeps the beat moving in a way that motivates the listener unlike any other song on the album.\n\nThe College Dropout also focuses on themes that greatly diverge from those prevalent at the time in the rap genre, namely: Family, College/Education, and Religion.\nThese changes in the typical themes of rap would eventually give an outlet of expression for rappers that didn't focus on gang culture and materialism (although the latter is somewhat present on this album as well… but discussed in a way that intersects with race issues.)\n\nWest's scope of storytelling is limited to the song it's present on, but don't discredit it for this, as the stories themselves are still captivating.\nOn \"All Falls Down,\" West tells the story of a young college student who's struggling with her future and materialism, and relates this story to his own, in a self-conscious fashion.\nAs the hypothetical woman struggles with her purpose in college and life, West talks about the expectations surrounding him, and how they ultimately reduce his character to his material worth.\nHowever, these lines also have another meaning, which talks about how society detracts black people’s worth.\n\n\"Even if you in a Benz, you still a ***** in a coupe\" - \"All Falls Down\"\n\nThis is also supported later in the third verse, in which West goes further into society’s treatment of black people as well as how his rise to fame and success will help him overcome this.\n\n\"'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth\" - \"All Falls Down\"\n\nBut this fear of materialism and institutionalized racism doesn't lead West to stray from rightfully bragging about his accomplishments, such as on \"Two Words.\"\nAfter a feature from Mos Def, an artist West had produced for in his mixtape days, West's verse shows how proud he truly is.\nIf there's one thing West promises to the listener on this track, it's that he plans to continue his rise to the top.\n\n\"Plus, I got a whole city to hold down // From the bottom, so the top's the only place to go now.\" - \"Two Words\"\n\nAll in all, The College Dropout is, at least in my opinion, one of the most influential Hip-Hop albums of the early 2000's.\nNot only did it mark the launch of West's career as a full-fledged producer-rapper, but the start of mainstream rap's shift away from the Gangsta rap genre.\n(a subject I'll return to on my review of Graduation.)\nWest's motivation as a young artist erupts for all to see on this record, and continues flaring from beginning to end.\n\nPersonally, I really enjoy coming back to this album every once in a while.\nWhile West's recent history has been... troubling... It's always nice to listen to good music.\nI don't think this is an album you necessarily need to listen to in order (as long as \"Last Call\" is last!), but it helps with overall flow of the album's themes.\nWest's next album, released a little over a year later, on August 30th, 2005.\n\nIf you're looking for something similar to this album, I recommend checking out Consequence's Take 'Em To The Cleaners, which was also produced by West around the same time.\nThe album also features numerous features from West, so I'd recommend that if you're missing the dropout era.\n\n(As a quick note, I'd like to go over my review formatting.\nReviews will be formatted in the \"melon\" style, with a XX/10 rating overall [with XX being an integer], then ratings of smaller categories.\nAll scores are evaluated in the context of when the album was released [excluding specific circumstances, and the Impact and Replayability categories])\n\nScore: Strong 10\nProduction: 10/10\nLyrics: 10/10\nFlow: 09/10\nImpact: 10/10\nStorytelling: 08/10\nInnovation: 09/10\nConsistency: 10/10\nReplayability: 10/10\n\nAmount of times the phrase \"mayonnaise colored benz\" used: 02/10\n\nMaxwell Villaraza-Steele\n\np.s. if there's anything parts of the album you think I missed, feel free to talk to me! i'd love to have a chat.\n",

    title: "From Roblox to Riches: How One ASTI Senior Made $100,000",
    content: `
    Around campus, Adikkya looks and acts like your run-of-the-mill ASTI phoenix- and, by most measures, he is. He gets good grades in his classes, enjoys playing sports in his free time, and he was outraged, like all of us, by the 50% price hike on Taco Bell’s “Spicy Potato Taco”. But when Adikkya gets home, powers on his computer, and boots up Roblox, he transforms from a typical high school student into his alter ego, a digital entrepreneur who has made over $100,000.
	Adikkya has always had a knack for making money, and an obsession with Roblox. As a middle schooler at Lincoln, he would buy and resell candy in order to make money to buy Robux, the game’s digital currency. “I was playing a lot of roblox, like all day,” Adikkya told me. “My brother would buy Robux all the time, but I didn’t have any, so that created a drive in me to earn money. And I was making bank from that candy!” The candy business opened Adikkya’s eyes to how anybody could make money if they take initiative, a takeaway which would be crucial in his future Roblox endeavors.
	“(In elementary school,) I was a fat little kid that played games all day,” Adikkya explained. “I was playing six, seven hours a day. I was a poor little kid, begging my mom to let me use her credit card, until one day I heard that it was possible to make Robux for yourself.” Roblox developers can make money by creating and monetizing games, selling assets, or working as freelance scripters, earning Robux that can be converted into real money through Roblox’s Developer Exchange Program, or DevEx. “I became really invested in the idea that I would make my own game.”
	As he entered middle school, Adikkya invested more of his time in getting familiar with the business. He taught himself 3D modeling and graphic creation, and began experimenting in the Roblox studio. But he also had more time to play the game itself, which would prove crucial to his entrance into the game creation industry through one of Roblox’s top game developers.
	Adikkya’s favorite game was called “Legendary Football”, one of Roblox’s many sports simulators, and with time and practice, he got really good. It was in this game that he met the successful Roblox developer Intrance. “(Intrance) had a checkmark, so I tried to make myself interesting by teaching him how to play Legendary Football. At first, I was a nobody to him. He thought I was a freeloader. But as I taught him how to play (the game), our friendship blossomed.” Eventually, Adikkya took a gamble- he asked Intrance, a millionaire and creator of such games as “Starving Artists” and “Bayside High School”, to help him out in getting into the commissioning business. The gamble paid off; Intrance put his new friend in contact with a team of programmers in the late stages of creating their game, and soon Adikkya found himself working with BadMash studios in the creation of what they were calling Slay Stars. When he arrived, though, there was already a team of four people working on the game- a coder, a music programmer, and two ‘builders’, who design and construct the in-game environment and assets. “I was a substitute on the building team. He said that instead, he would just hire me for commissions, since they already had builders. I felt pretty demotivated at first, but during the time that I wasn’t needed I kept learning new things.”
	And eventually, his time came- one of the builders got a full time job somewhere else, and Adikkya was officially part of the Slay Stars team. But now that Adikkya had any say in it, that name wouldn’t last long. “I didn’t like the name. I told them that Slay Stars sounded corny, so I suggested the name Slaying Simulator.” That name has stuck to this day.
	Adikkya stepped in at a stressful time for BadMash studios- Slaying Simulator was set to launch in a week and a half, but the game was still missing some key components- most prominently, a map. “They told me that they needed a map for the game, so I made them a map,” Adikkya told me with a grin. “They tried to offer me $200, but I knew the leverage that I had, so I came back asking for 30% of the profits from the game. They refused, but we eventually renegotiated down to 15%. (In normal circumstances,) they probably wouldn’t have even done 10%, but they were under a real time crunch, and I had the finished map that they wanted.” 
	The game was released on time in December of 2018, and met decent success; through in-game purchases, the game was making Adikkya about 6400 robux monthly, or $80 USD, a lot for a kid who was still bracing for puberty. This success was just the beginning though- through promotion from YouTuber Tofuu, a channel with nearly 4 million subscribers, and a little bit of Christmas magic, the game would eventually make Adikkya thousands- though not until years after its initial release. 
“It was Christmas of 2020, and I had just turned fourteen. That December I made $9,000. Usually, a game will make at least quadruple its usual earnings during the holiday season. But our game grew exponentially- I was making ten fold of what I was making in a normal month that year.” This boom in success was due to a couple of factors. For one, Slaying Simulator had released a series of popular updates in the months leading up to the New Year. In addition, millions of kids across America were putting Robux at the top of their Christmas lists. From the months of October 2020-January 2021, Slaying Simulator received over 25,000,000 visits. “I was just a fourteen year old kid,” reflected Adikkya. “It felt unreal.”
As the Robux were rolling in, Adikkya began to cash in most of the in-game currency for real money, using Roblox’s DevEx program. “I took out $96,000 dollars before taxes, so after taxes it was $60,000 dollars or something,” he lamented. “That was the big paycheck from the success we had had up to early 2021.” But even past his big payday, the Robux kept flowing in, though less than before- and this time, Adikkya didn’t plan to cash out.
“I liked having Robux in my account. I was living my childhood dream. I still didn’t understand that it was so much more valuable to have real money- even after I took most of it out, I still wanted a bunch in my account, just to mess around and have a good time on Roblox. This was when I got into trading.” Like in the real world, Roblox clothing items all have different values, the most valuable of which have sold for the equivalent of over $100,000 USD. If you get limited edition items right when they drop, you can resell them for a lot more Robux later. “There was this new item that came out that was a limited edition, and I wanted it. I met a guy on Roblox who said he made a robot who could ‘snipe’ it for me, for just eight dollars. But because there’s so much money getting thrown around in the trading world, there’s a lot of shady people.” And unfortunately for Adikkya, this bot-salesman was one of them. When Adikkya clicked the link to download his new plug-in, it was actually an exe file, which collected all of his Roblox account data. But all Adikkya saw was a blank screen, and he assumed “​​I just waited, I left, I went to sleep. When I woke up the next morning, it said I was banned.” Adikkya, now a freshman at ASTI, contacted Roblox support to figure out what had happened. It turns out that the trickster had hacked into Adikkya’s account, transferred out all of his Robux, and then posted inappropriate messages and images under Adikkya’s name. “I started crying when I realized what happened. I got my account back, but not the robux I had lost. It was about $40,000 worth, I think, but I didn’t even know exactly how much was in my account. I was too devastated to calculate.” 
Slaying Simulator stopped updating and faded into irrelevance, drying out Adikkya’s income stream. The incident haunted him for months. “I tried to be as positive as I could. My mom told me to focus on my academics and take what I had learned to create a new game. But I couldn’t wipe from my mind that I had lost that money.” Adikkya freelanced on Roblox throughout Sophomore year, making a couple hundred dollars a month, but the pay wasn’t worth it for him anymore. To Adikkya Rahman, a couple hundred bucks was chump change.
Instead, he started investing more time in his personal life. He played football for Alameda High, focused harder on his classes, and spent hours after school bonding with classmates around the dirty tables of Taco Bell. He realized that the best way to make a consistent income would be to study hard and get a good job, like his parents had always wanted. Roblox would have to take a back seat. 
That all changed, though, when Intrance reconnected with Adikkya in the summer of 2023. “He told me that he really liked what he had seen from me in ‘Slaying Simulator’. I reminded him of himself. So that’s when he told me that if I needed funds to start a new game, he would give me 10,000 dollars, off the bat, and he offered to pay for anything I needed, as long as I promised him that I would get a game done.” And with that, Adikkya was back on the Roblox grind, this time creating his own original game, titled Ant Colony Simulator.  The game has faced setbacks, but it's set to release this December. 
As Adikkya looks ahead to the release of Ant Colony Simulator, he’s keenly aware of how much he has grown since his days selling candy and playing eight hours a day of Roblox. “The hard times were really hard. They really tested me. But I came out of them a smarter person, with more depth. I also made a bunch of money.” Adikkya tried not to let the success get to his head- he still works hard in school, enjoys spending time with friends, and hopes to attend Stanford University next fall. But even Adikkya admits the money has changed him- at least in his restaurant preferences. “I don’t go to Taco Bell anymore. I’m a baller now- I have chipotle money.”`,

    title: "BEETLEJUICE! BEETLEJUICE! BEETLEJUICE!- Original Movie Review",
    content:
      "A blast from the past! As the fan-favorite ‘Beetlejuice’ movie gets its remake, ‘Beetlejuice Beetlejuice’, an honorary visit back to the Tim Burton classic is much needed. \nThe late 80’s movie is centered around a couple, Adam and Barbara Maitland, who unexpectedly die, and find themselves stuck haunting their former home. As a new family moves in, the dead try everything to make them leave, so they call the only man fit for the job: Beetlejuice.\nThroughout the movie, the three main characters go on a rollercoaster of emotions and adventures to save the house as the Maitlands come to realize that they’ve made a mistake asking the ‘bio-exorcist’ for help. \nThis was a wildly fun movie, as it explores areas that were unique in its time. Burton’s Gothic aesthetic creates an eccentric visual style that is both eerie and captivating. Michael Keaton’s Beetlejuice has a chaotic yet charismatic character that perfectly balances out with the Maitlands’ sweet personalities. \nSurprisingly, it's very well paced and directed, or at least for me. The film ends on a playful note as the living and the dead accept one another and find peace with each other's elements. I would give this movie an 8/10 for its indie-like cinematography, and very nostalgic feeling. There’s no wonder this dark fantasy comedy is a cult-classic in many households!",

    title: "Transformers One is Worthy of Your Time - Movie Review",
    content:
      "In the past few years, the film landscape has changed in a major way.\n Just a few years ago, it was a guarantee that any film in a popular franchise would make its budget back and then some.\n But now, ever since the pandemic, there is no certainty in what films will make money and what will be a box office disappointment.\n And it’s sad that even when big franchise films are surprisingly great, like Sony’s Spider-Verse series, there isn’t a guarantee that they’ll be successful, and we’ve seen that recently with Josh Cooley’s Transformers One.\n This is very unfortunate, because unlike many other franchise films being released, Transformers One is definitely a film that deserves to be a big hit.\n\n To be honest, my expectations were never super high for this film.\n The marketing made it seem like it would be aimed primarily towards little kids, with the humor appearing to be a bit overbearing in the film’s trailers.\n But when I went to see this film, my mind was kind of blown.\n This film is not only funny, but is filled with heart, passion, and a far more mature story than the trailers made it seem.\n\n Transformers One follows Orion Pax and D-16, two robot friends working as miners on the futuristic Planet Cybertron, who would go on to be sworn enemies, Optimus Prime and Megatron.\n Soon, the two attempt to find and retrieve the Matrix of Leadership, a powerful device that could potentially restore peace across all of Cybertron.\n However, as they proceed on their mission, Orion and D-16 begin to form new ideologies, and begin to drift further apart as they both attempt to stop a threat against their planet.\n\n Like I said, this film REALLY surprised me.\n I was initially turned off by the voice actors picked for the film.\n Chris Hemsworth as Orion Pax seemed like another “Chris Pratt as Mario” situation waiting to happen.\n But he was surprisingly excellent.\n At no point did I hear a celebrity phoning it in, I just believed that I was watching the character that Hemsworth was voicing.\n That goes for nearly every other voice actor as well, especially Hemsworth and Brian Tyree Henry, who voiced D-16.\n\n If I had any faults with this film, I would say that some moments with B-127 (played by Keegan-Michael Key) felt a bit out of place in terms of where they were placed in the film.\n Also, while I found the film to be very well-paced, I’d prefer it if there were at least 10 to 15 extra minutes spent with Orion and D-16 before the plot begins moving forward.\n What we get works well, but it may have benefited from even more time to fully sell us on their friendship.\n\n Other than those minor complaints, Transformers One is a surprising home-run for the franchise, and is worthy of your money and time.\n Please make sure to see it while it’s still in theaters.\n It is one of my favorite films of the year so far, and I’d highly recommend it.\n Transformers One gets an 8/10.",

    title: "Man Made Monsters: A Review",
    content:
      "Man Made Monsters is without a doubt one of the most beautifully crafted, unique books I have ever come across. A novel that effortlessly jumps from sci-fi, to dystopia, to fantasy, each chapter is a self contained horror story featuring different generational members of one Cherokee family, in total spanning all the way from the 1800s to our future. Its concept alone is so eye-catching that I was concerned the book’s execution may not be able to hold up. And yet, over the first fifty pages it forcefully propelled itself into my top three of all time.\n So what exactly makes Andrea L. Roger’s debut work so thrilling? I could gush about the sheer beauty of the physical book itself, wonder at the stunning cover art and intricate illustrations which precede every chapter. I could tell you how it is the perfect book to pick up during a reading slump, thanks to the quick, freestanding tales that make up each installment. Perhaps it might sway someone to know that thanks to its largely psychological approach to horror, Man Made Monsters is an excellent choice for someone new to the genre. None of this would do it justice. To put things very simply, the ingenious writing, capable of perfectly balancing suspense and shock at all times, chilling one moment and the next oddly sweet, is what makes this book so captivating. Unquestionably, Man Made Monsters is an absolute must read for any fan of horror.",

    title: "“Timeless” - The Weeknd",
    content:
      "While everyone is still patiently waiting on The Weeknd’s upcoming album, Hurry Up Tomorrow, he has dropped his second single, “Timeless”. The new single features the popular rapper Playboi Carti as a vocalist, and Mike Dean and Pharrell Williams as producers. The beat reminded me of a beat off his first big album, Starboy- which along with Dawn FM and Hurry Up Tomorrow will create the Weeknd’s album trilogy. In Playboi Carti’s verse, he switches between his normal voice and his famous baby voice, which is notable because he’s recently been experimenting with rapping in a deeper voice, like in his new single “ALL RED”. \n\n“Timeless” is about being genuine and being exactly how you present yourself since childhood, as reflected in the lyrics. One such example is  “Ever since I was a jit, knew I was the (censored)” In my opinion, the song sounds very nostalgic because of the beat being so similar to the Weeknd’s 2016 hits which kicked off his rise to pop stardom. I would rate this song a 8/10 because it’s a fun single with two of the most influential artists of our generation, and it definitely gets me excited for The Weeknd’s new album.",

      'It has been a week since Bonding Day—the day where we come together on the field and do activities with students from different grades. Now that it’s over, we’ve had the chance to ask people their opinions of the event.\n Sophomore Judah Nyquist didn’t have the most positive experience, stating: "Uhh, it sucked in my opinion. It was really hot and the games were boring. The trivia [game] was the only good part."\nOther people had more complex opinions. Henry Rudriego, a sophomore, said, "I thought Bonding Day was pretty enjoyable. I feel like some of the activities were simple in their own right, but I feel that they were a little too complicated for the Bonding Day setting. Like the whole game where you have to find words and the water pong game—it wasn’t very engaging. I drifted off. I wasn’t really engaged that way, but a lot of the other games were pretty fun."\n It seems like Bonding Day needs some improvement, but with a few fixes and better weather, it can become an even more enjoyable experience for all students',

    content:
      "Mix It Up Lunch was an event that was all about connecting leadership students with freshmen in the coolest way—through penpalling! Over a month, pairs exchanged letters filled with their stories, hopes, and hilarious moments, building excitement for the big reveal.\nThe grand finale happened on the rooftop, where everyone came together for a super fun lunch party! \nPicture this: delicious pizza, fizzy soda, and the thrill of finally meeting your penpal face-to-face. The air was buzzing with excitement as friendships blossomed! After a quick meet-and-greet, groups were free to go wherever they wanted. Many couldn’t resist the call of Taco Bell, thanks to Benji’s enthusiastic recommendation. Others ventured over to Rare Tea for a refreshing boba. \nMix It Up Lunch was more than just a meal; it was an unforgettable day filled with laughter, great food, and new friendships! Who knew a simple lunch could lead to such amazing connections? We can't wait for future school events!",

    title: "Our Wonderful STEM club",
    content:
      "With an eye for innovation and a mind for tech, club co-president Max Steele has shown me the true potential of STEM club. Collaborative projects and STEM competitions are the main foci of the club, as they say, and they want your support! Even if you are unfamiliar with STEM, there will be lessons along the way during every meeting to keep you in your most analytical state of mind. Don’t forget, everyone, we live in a world governed by STEM- and this is your best opportunity to break into it. I once loathed the very ideas of science and mathematics, but after seeing their first slideshow and witnessing the club’s opportunities, such as Lego Robotics competitions, I have become fascinated with the possibilities. The club meets during lunch: Tuesdays in Mr. Long’s room (3) and Thursdays in Mr. Hallsted’s room (6). Co-Presidents Max Steele and Rita Song, along with STEM Club’s officers are eager to have you collaborating with them on STEM’s projects.",
